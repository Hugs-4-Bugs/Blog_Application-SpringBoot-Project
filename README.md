# Blog Application

This is a simple blogging application developed using Spring Security for authentication and authorization. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Implemented with Spring Security to manage user access.
- **Token Generation:** Utilizes Postman for generating authentication tokens.
- **CRUD Operations:** Allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog posts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven
- Spring Boot
- Postman (for token generation)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Hugs-4-Bugs/Blog_Application-SpringBoot-Project`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Blog_Application-SpringBoot-Project`
3. Build the project: `mvn clean install`
4. Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`

### Usage

1. Generate Authentication Token:
   - Use Postman to send a request to the authentication endpoint and obtain an access token.
   - Example: `POST /api/authenticate`

2. Accessing Endpoints:
   - Use the generated token in the header for subsequent requests to access secured endpoints.
   - Example: `GET /api/posts` to retrieve all blog posts.

3. Perform CRUD Operations:
   - Use appropriate HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) with respective endpoints to manage blog posts.

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/authenticate`: Generate authentication token.
- `GET /api/posts`: Retrieve all blog posts.
- `GET /api/posts/{id}`: Retrieve a specific blog post by ID.
- `POST /api/posts`: Create a new blog post.
